# Profile guide
## Overview
This repository is just a way to somehow organize my github, as github doesn't provide folders or anything similar. Here I will store references to my main repos with brief description.
Full description can be found on the corresponding repo's page. Most of the repos contain ***unit tests***, some of them contain ***continuous integration*** via Github Actions.
## Contents
* [Winapi repo](https://github.com/nikita-kasinski/os-lab). The repo features 5 tasks on multithreading and synchronization with such topics covered as ***threads***, ***processes***, ***events***, ***mutexes*** and ***pipes***. The last task from the repo additionally features ***smart pointers*** and ***std::expected*** from c++23
* [std::thread repo](https://github.com/nikita-kasinski/std-thread). The repo features matrix product using standart library threads and some tools like ***sanitizer***, ***linter***, ***dynamic analysis tools***. The repo also touches part of the ***ranges*** library
* [Qt + computer graphics repo](https://github.com/nikita-kasinski/pkg). The repo features ***Qt framework*** usage for illustrating some aspects of computer graphics. The repo is quite old as it isn't organized properly and doesn't contain unit tests but I plan to change this soon
